## 🚀 About Me

I am a **2nd Year B.Sc. Information Technology (Data Science)** student with a strong interest in **Data Science and Machine Learning**.

I focus on **learning by building**. Instead of claiming large academic projects, I have created and deployed **multiple machine learning applications**, each demonstrating a different algorithm and its real-world usage.

What defines me:

* 🧠 Strong fundamentals in machine learning algorithms
* 🛠️ Hands-on learning through deployed ML apps
* 🚀 Ability to convert theory into working applications

I believe **consistent practice and real implementation** are the fastest ways to grow in tech.

📍 **Location:** India
🎓 **Degree:** B.Sc. IT (Data Science) – 2nd Year
🎯 **Interests:** Data Science, Machine Learning
